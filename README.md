# SimpleHomePage
A clean, easily configurable homepage for your web browser with embeded duckduckgo search box.
To configure, simply edit the relevant css fields.
Due to copyright restrictions, I cannot upload the background image I use in my copy, so add your own background image saved as "background.jpg" to use one.

# Usage guide
-To use this as your homepage, first ensure that both homepage.html and backrgound.html are in the same folder, one that you will not move or delete.

-Then copy the full adress of homempage.html.

-Finally, go into your browser's settings and locate the option to change homepage, and paste in the adress of homepage.hmtl

It is now your homepage.
